2. Set a secondary color
    - Duplicate your main color
    - Change color mode to HSB in picker
    - set the S (saturation) value between 5-10 points 
    - set the B (Brightness) value between 95-100 points
    - set

    - Duplicate Main color
    - Increase or decrease H (hue) by 30-40 points
    - Increase B (brightness) value by 5-10 points

4. We now have a 3 color scheme 
    - 60/30/10 rule
    - 60% of the color is the main color
    - 30% secondary
    - 10% accent
5. Apply this rule to your layout
